## Creating GDS variables - Part 2

Now that we have seen how the plcncli can help us, let's use it to create a component that registers some fields as GDS variables.

If your component does not need to create GDS variables, then the component and library templates we have been using up until now, will work perfectly well. the components created by the plcncli will also work, but they will include overhead that is not necessary for all cases.

- create a project
- show how to register GDS variables.
- Now use the Data Access service to read/write these variables from another component.
- Link to other features - OPC UA, Retain, etc - in info center.
