## REST API

Another way to access GDS variables.

- Link to [PLCnext Technology Info Center][rest-info].

- Example showing how to transfer data into / out of a component (e.g. from system variables) using a gds.config file.

- Advantage: Very simple to set up. No code required. Can access I/O variables (this is not possible using RSC services)
- Disadvantage: All GDS variables must be defined and connected at design-time. The RSC service provides more flexibility, if required.
