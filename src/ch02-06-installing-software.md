## Installing Software

Now that you are familiar with some of the features of the Linux operating system on the PLCnext Control, lets see how you can extend the functionality of the controller by installing third-party software.

Option include:

* Use a package manager (not directly supported)

* If there is no suitable repository, directly install a pre-built binary, if available. This must be built for a compatible architecture (e.g. armv7 32 bit).

* Cross-compile an open-source project using a PLCnext Control SDK.

* Load an application from the PLCnext Store.

* Install a container engine like Balena Engine or Docker, download OCI images and run containers.
