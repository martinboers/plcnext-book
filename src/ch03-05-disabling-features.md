## Disabling Features

By default, the PLCnext runtime starts a large number of components. These components implement services or features on the device. In some circumstances it may be desirable to disable some of these features - for example, you want to free the resources that unused services would otherwise consume.

It is possible to disable some system features through the Web-Based Management (WBM) page of the device. This is described in the PLCnext Info Center:

In the next chapter, you will see how to add your own custom component to this list.
