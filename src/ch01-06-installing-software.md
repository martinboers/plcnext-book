## Installing Software

Now that you are familiar with some of the features of the Linux operating system on the PLCnext Control, lets see how you can extend the functionality of the controller by installing third-party software.

OPTIONS:

* Use a package manager - which one? Which repository?

* If there is no suitable repository, directly install a pre-built binary, if available. This must be built for a compatible architecture (e.g. armv7 32 bit).

* Cross-compile an open-source project using a PLCnext Control SDK. This will be covered later in the book.

(mention Docker, somewhere)
