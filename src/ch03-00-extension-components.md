# Extension Components

In the previous chapter, you saw how the PLCnext runtime uses factory-installed components to implement various functions.

It is possible to extend the PLCnext runtime with your own components. These are called *Extension Components* (also called *Internal Function Extensions*).

In this chapter, you will write your own extension component that is started by the PLCnext runtime, and learn more about the Application Component Framework (ACF) that makes this possible.
