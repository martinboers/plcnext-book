# Extension Components

In the previous chapter, you saw how the PLCnext runtime uses components to implement various functions.

It is possible to extend the PLCnext runtime with your own components. These are called *Extension Components*.

In this chapter, you will write your own extension component that is started by the PLCnext runtime, and learn more about the Application Component Framework (ACF) that makes this possible.
