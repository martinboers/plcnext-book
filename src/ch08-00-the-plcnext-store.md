# The PLCnext Store

Particularly suited to:

- PLCnext Engineer libraries
- Solution apps - which turn the PLC into a vendor-specific control device.
- Any type of software that must be bought by customers. The store includes software licence management and secure payment processing.

It is also possible to host free extension components and runtime applications in the plcnext store, as an alternative to hosting these in public repositories.

Refer to documentation explaining how to package PLCnext Store apps.
