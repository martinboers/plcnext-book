## Installing a Software Development Kit

You can build native applications for a PLCnext Control - either from third-party open-source code, or from your own code. To do this, you must install a software development kit (SDK) on the host, corresponding to the firmware that is running on the PLCnext Control. The SDK contains the build tools and other resources required to create native applications for the target.

### PLCnext Command Line Interface

Software development kits for PLCnext Control targets are installed and managed using a command-line interface (CLI), called the *PLCnext CLI* or `plcncli`. It is possible to install SDKs on the host without using `plcncli`, but `plcncli` provides important features that will be required in later chapters of this book. For this reason, it is highly recommended to install and manage SDKs using `plcncli`.

To install `plcncli` on your host:

* Download the file *PLCnext Technology C ++ Toolchain f√ºr Linux* from the Phoenix Contact website. For example, the file `PLCnCLI_SDK_2020.0_Linux_AXC_F_2152.zip` is for the AXC F 2152 running firmware version 2020.0.

* Extract the files from the archive.

* In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the files were extracted.

* Run the script to set up `plcncli` on the host, specifying the directory where the package should be installed.

   ```text
   $ ./PLCnCLI_Setup.sh --target ~/plcncli
   (todo: response))
   ```

* Create a symbolic link to the `plcncli` executable, as suggested by the installation message.

* Check that the installation has been successful.

   ```text
   $ plcncli
   (todo: response))
   ```

### PLCnext SDK

* In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the files were extracted from the archive.

* Use plcncli to install the SDK. You are free to specify any destination directory you want, using the `-d` option.

   ```text
   $ plcncli install sdk -p pxc-glibc-x86_64-axcf2152-image-sdk-cortexa9t2hf-neon-axcf2152-toolchain-2020.0.sh -d /opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2020.0
   (todo: response))
   ```

* Check what SDKs and targets have been installed.

   ```text
   $ plcncli get sdks
   (todo: response))
   ```

   ```text
   $ plcncli get targets
   (todo: response))
   ```

If you need to build applications for different PLCnext Control hardware and/or firmware variants, then it is possible to use `plcncli` to install multiple SDKs on the host. To do this, simply repeat the SDK installation procedure for each additional SDK. There is no need to install `plcncli` again.

### Building on target

The software development process for PLCnext Control - cross-compiling on a host, then deploying to a target - will be familiar to those with experience in embedded systems software development, but other programmers often wonder why they cannot build their PLCnext Control applications directly on the target device. The reason is that the resources required to run development and build tools are often orders of magnitude greater than those required to run the final application, and the types of applications for which PLCnext Control is designed cannot justify the cost of these additional resources (e.g. memory and CPU power). For this reason, PLCnext Control should be considered more like an embedded device than a full-featured computer.
