## Installing a Software Development Kit

You can build native applications for a PLCnext Control - either from third-party open-source code, or from your own code. To do this, you must install a software development kit (SDK) on the host, corresponding to the firmware that is running on the PLCnext Control. The SDK contains the build tools and other resources required to create native applications for the target.

### PLCnext Command Line Interface

Software development kits for PLCnext Control targets are installed and managed using a command-line interface (CLI), called the *PLCnext CLI* or `plcncli`. It is possible to install SDKs on the host without using `plcncli`, but `plcncli` provides important features that will be required in later chapters of this book. For this reason, it is highly recommended to install and manage SDKs using `plcncli`.

To install `plcncli` on your host:

* Download the file *PLCnext Technology C ++ Toolchain f√ºr Linux* from the Phoenix Contact website. For example, the file `PLCnCLI_SDK_2020.0_Linux_AXC_F_2152.zip` is for the AXC F 2152 running firmware version 2020.0.

* Extract the files from the archive.

* In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the files were extracted.

* Run the script to set up `plcncli` on the host, specifying the directory where the package should be installed.

   ```text
   $ ./PLCnCLI_Setup.sh --target ~/plcncli
   (todo: response))
   ```

* Create a symbolic link to the `plcncli` executable, as suggested by the installation message.

* Check that the installation has been successful.

   ```text
   $ plcncli
   (todo: response))
   ```

### PLCnext SDK

* In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the files were extracted from the archive.

* Use plcncli to install the SDK. You are free to specify any destination directory you want, using the `-d` option.

   ```text
   $ plcncli install sdk -p pxc-glibc-x86_64-axcf2152-image-sdk-cortexa9t2hf-neon-axcf2152-toolchain-2020.0.sh -d /opt/pxc/sdk/AXCF2152/2020.0
   (todo: response))
   ```

* Check what SDKs and targets have been installed.

   ```text
   $ plcncli get sdks
   (todo: response))
   ```

   ```text
   $ plcncli get targets
   (todo: response))
   ```

If you need to build applications for different PLCnext Control hardware and/or firmware variants, then it is possible to use `plcncli` to install multiple SDKs on the host. To do this, simply repeat the SDK installation procedure for each additional SDK. There is no need to install `plcncli` again.
