# PLCnext Runtime

PLCnext Control firmware was introduced briefly in the previous chapter. PLCnext Control firmware features can be broadly categorised as either:

1. Features commonly available on general-purpose Linux distributions, or
2. Features developed by Phoenix Contact, that are not available on other Linux distributions.

The second group of features includes:

* commands like `update-plcnext` and `recover-plcnext` that you saw previously, and
* software components that are started and controlled by the *PLCnext runtime*.

This chapter will look at:

* Controlling the PLCnext runtime
* PLCnext components
* Component instances
* Disabling features of the PLCnext runtime
