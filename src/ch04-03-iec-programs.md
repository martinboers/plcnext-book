## ECLR

As the name suggests, the Embedded Common Language Runtime (ECLR) is based on Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is required to run C# and other .NET programs on Windows platforms. Unlike the CLR, the ECLR is specifically designed to run real-time, deterministic programs on embedded devices. The ECLR contains a sub-set of ECLR libraries, along with specialised libraries added by Phoenix Contact.
