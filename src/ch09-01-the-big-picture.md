## The Big Picture

This book has covered almost every part of the PLCnext Control platform, including an extensive step-by-step exploration of the PLCnext runtime. At this stage, it is beneficial to zoom out and take a look at how all the pieces of the PLCnext Control platform fit together. One of the best ways to do this is to work through the interactive online course [*PLCnext Technology Basics*][course] on the PLCnext Community website. In addition to the topics covered in this book, the course will introduce you to the other parts of the PLCnext Technology Ecosystem, including PLCnext Engineer and [the PLCnext Store][store].
